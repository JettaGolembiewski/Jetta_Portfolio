    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      I take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we
      collect, use, and protect personal information that we collect from users
      who visit our website.

    <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
    <p>
      I collect personal information when users voluntarily submit it to us.
      This includes information such as name, email address, and other contact
      information. We may also collect information automatically through the use
      of cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      I use the personal information we collect to provide and improve our
      services, respond to user inquiries, and communicate with users about our
      products and services. We may also use the information for marketing
      purposes, such as sending promotional emails and newsletters.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>
      I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personal information to
      outside parties. However, we may disclose information to trusted
      third-party service providers who assist us in operating our website and
      conducting our business. We may also disclose information when required by
      law or in response to a court order or subpoena.
    </p>

    <h2>Protection of Information</h2>
    <p>
      I take reasonable measures to protect personal information from
      unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of
      transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure,
      and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

      My website is not intended for children under the age of 13, and I do not
      knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

      version will be posted on our website.
