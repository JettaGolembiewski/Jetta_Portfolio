Digital Product Management Final Project

This project allowed me to wrap up all my skills that I have learned and combined them into one main platform. 

I first started by finding a free html template that I could copy and use. Next I started to fill in all my information and make sure the files were validated. 

After my site was up and running I created a google analytics account to track the amount of users that visit my site. 

To wrap up the project I finished with a report to show everything I have done.
